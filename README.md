# Amazon-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of this project is to perform Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Amazon is the World's leading E-commerce Site and i felt this was a great opportunity to see what their customers feel about some of their products. In this Notebook, several python libraries were utilized. For example, BeautifulSoup (to web scrape data from Amazon.co.uk), Pandas( for Data Cleaning/Manipulation), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), TextBlob(for Sentiment Analysis), Matplotlib &amp; Wordcloud (for Data Exploration), Plotly (for Data Visualization)
